# Machine-Learning
Data science projects

This study looked into assessing the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings (that is, energy efficiency)
as a function of building parameters. First I applied simple machine learning models like KNN, logistic regression, random forest,
decision tree, linear & kernalised SVM and compared the precision and recall of each of the above mentioned models. After running the simple 
models I wanted to see how these models perform after bagging and boosting. As the data file had 220+ variables, PCA looked as the best option.
Hence after performing PCA on the above models we got the best model with accuracy as 75%.
